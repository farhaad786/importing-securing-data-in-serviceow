üìù About the Project
Project Title: Importing & Securing Data in ServiceNow

Overview:
This project explores how data can be efficiently imported and securely managed within the ServiceNow platform, a widely used cloud-based IT service management (ITSM) tool. The project focuses on both the technical processes of data import and the security mechanisms necessary to protect sensitive information in enterprise environments.

üîç Key Objectives:
To understand how data is imported into ServiceNow using data sources and transform maps.

To explore the different file formats supported during import (CSV, Excel, XML, etc.).

To implement Access Control Rules (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) for securing data.

To evaluate best practices for ensuring data integrity, compliance, and confidentiality.

üõ† Project Features:
Use of Import Set Tables and Transform Maps

Application of Access Control Editor and data policies

Securing imported data using roles, conditions, and encryption

Testing with scheduled data imports and sandbox environment

‚úÖ Outcome:
By the end of this project, a secure and systematic approach to data import in ServiceNow was achieved. This ensures reliable data integration while maintaining high standards of security and compliance across the platform.
